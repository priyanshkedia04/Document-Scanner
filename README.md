# Document-Scanner

Document Scanner using OpenCV and Python. Click the photo of your document and use this code will help you to scan and automatically remove all the unwanted background objects in the image resulting in a proper cut-out of Document.

Building a document scanner with OpenCV can be accomplished in just three simple steps:

Step 1: Detect edges.
Step 2: Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
Step 3: Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
